title: Sbagliato (Broken Negroni)
---

For a lower-proof (but still delicious) twist, try a Negroni Sbagliato, which roughly translates to “Broken Negroni”, by substituting sparkling wine for gin.

- 1oz prosecco
- 1oz Campari
- 1oz sweet vermouth
- lemon twist

Add prosecco, Campari, and vermouth into a mixing glass. Fill glass with ice and stir. Serve up with a twist of lemon.
